<h1>Snowbard E-Commerce CRUD Application</h1>

A small CRUD application designed using my favourite snowboard brand. This project was built using React and styled with SASS.

<h1>Inspiration</h1>
I designed this project with just functionality in mind. I wanted to work on something that was more heavily Javascript based rather than styling. (I feel that sometimes styling can become a distraction and get in the way of learning functionality). I wanted to showcase my ability to create CRUD actions and thought that an e-commerce application would be a great place to show that. Eventhough I did mention that this project was all about functionality, I did go in and add some inline styling and stylesheets at the end to enhance the overall look of the project. All content displayed on the website is credited to Bataleon Snowboards as I used there images and products to create the app. I decided to go with a real brand because it makes me more passionate about the overall project.

<h1>Summary</h1>
With this design, I spent most of time creating functions and state to handle the CRUD actions used to power the project. 
I learned a lot from this project and it was quiet challenging at times handling the overall state of the app and passing props through each component. If I was to make something similiar again, I would used a state management tool to centralize the state. This would definitely make things a lot easier to manage and would be more time efficient. I will be considering using Redux next time to help with these issues.
